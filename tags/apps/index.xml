      <description>As you will see, the one below is a pretty opinionated list.
I avoid apps that try to do a thousand different things and end up doing all of them in a bad way. I much prefer simple apps that have great UX, beautiful UI, and a clear set of features.
I also try to follow the concept of [Max VP] when selecting which apps to use and I try to focus on what I really need from them.</description>

      <title>Maximum Viable Product</title>

      <description>I recently found out about this concept which explains perfectly what I think a great product should represent.
We can define the Maximum Viable Product (Max VP) as a product that has just those features that allow it to be successful and no more. Customer needs are being met.
Instead of infinite grow (a concept at this point engrained in Silicon Valley companies) and the continuous adding of new features, a Max VP is a finely tuned engine that runs at full speed, where every feature has been carefully implemented and the UX is king.</description>
