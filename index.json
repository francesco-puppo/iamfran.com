Hugo checks all these three boxes.\nHugo is open source and the site is hosted on Github, all for free. Posts are written using Markdown and you can use your preferred app to manage them. There are themes available which can easily be customised using CSS. For more information on how to set up your site with Hugo have a look at their official documentation . If you want to have a look at how I set up this website, here\u0026rsquo;s the Github repository .\n","permalink":"https://iamfran.com/posts/2023/01/new-year-new-website-2023-edition/","summary":"As tradition, I redesigned my website for the new year.

If you want to download it immediately, please head over to üëâ GitHub .\nDark palette with orange highlights I used a dark palette with some orange highlights to mimic the look and feel of my site but don‚Äôt worry, changing it is super easy thanks to CSS variables.\nCSS variables Thanks to CSS variables you can easily the colours and fonts of the theme with just a few clicks. No need to hunt down all the references to a specific color in the CSS. Check the beginning of the file to see all of the variables I have used and easily replace them.\nBeautiful fonts A selection of Google fonts now replace the default font set by Write.as. Cormorant Garamond has been used for titles and everything else is in Open Sans. Source Code Pro applies to to tags and other \u0026ldquo;code-like\u0026rdquo; elements.\nWhite background for articles As much as I love using dark palette schemes, I hate reading long articles that use a dark background.\nFully responsive Honestly, I didn‚Äôt have to do too much here since write.as is already well optisized for mobile.\nThe main thing I did is increasing the font size of the articles.\nAnimations Don‚Äôt expect crazy things. I wanted to keep the focus on the content. Apart from some hover effects, the only animations I added are on the hashtag near the titles of the articles and on the images.\nShadows for every image Every image displays a soft shadow behind it. A small touch that makes everything look more professional.\nCustomised pages for tags archives When clicking on a tag (i.e. #movies), Write.as automatically generates a page to browse through all the articles tagged with it. Those pages have been customised as well.\nLove for the details The ones above are just some of the refinements I added but is there is a lot more, like a subtle light gradient coming from the top of the page, or the rounded corners in the article page, the fonts pairing, etc.\nHow to edit it To edit the theme, download it from GitHub and open it in an editor like Visual Studio Code .\nIf you want to change the variables of the color, for example, you can find them at the beginning of the file. Changing these will change the colours across the entire theme.\nI tried to keep the CSS as clean as possible, so it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem finding things.\nHow to install it Download the theme from GitHub and then head over to Write.as.\nIn your blog settings search for Customise, and then scroll down to Custom CSS. Paste the code, and then click on Save changes.\nüëâ Download it on GitHub ","permalink":"https://iamfran.com/posts/2022/02/a-dark-theme-for-write.as/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.snap.as/xZuovPhQ.jpg\" alt=\"Theme preview\"  /\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took some time yesterday to customise my blog and create this \u003cem\u003ebeautiful\u003c/em\u003e theme for the blogging platform I use.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"A Dark Theme For write.as"},{"content":"Bio I like taking pictures (especially when I travel), watching movies , and reading books .\nCV Mar 2022 ‚Äî current Head of UX Design at Greenflux Redesigning our product to stand out in the global marketplace Creating a new Design System to support the growth of our platform Implementing UX reasoning and research in our design process Mar 2017 ‚Äî Feb 2022 Design Director at Spotzer Managing the global Design and WP Development teams Overviewing the production of up to 4000 sites per month Redefining processes to improve business scalability Design PoC for all of global Partners Oct 2016 - Feb 2017 Lead Designer at Spotzer Developing Design Guidelines and training sessions Restructuring the team to support the business growth Improving our templates and design scalability Jun 2016 - Sep 2016 Web Designer at Spotzer Designing websites, logos, and templates Supporting the launch of new Partners Training employees in design best practices Dec 2015 - May 2016 Graphic Designer at Obiettivo Crescita\nRebranding of the magazine Designing the monthly cover art Building the main website as well as partners sites Mar 2009 - Nov 2015 3D Designer at HG Architecture\nDesigning architecture plans in Archicad and AutoCAD Modelling 3D objects in Rhinoceros and Blender Rendering and editing images in Photoshop Education Bachelor Degree in Architecture\nSkills User Experience Design Systems Interface/Product Design Project Management Product Management Team Management Workflows Improvement Problem Solving Business Scalability Web Design Download And for those who still like using actual paper, here you can download my CV as a PDF file.\n","permalink":"https://iamfran.com/about/","summary":"about","title":"About"},{"content":" An Icon For mymind ","permalink":"https://iamfran.com/projects/","summary":"about","title":"Projects"}]
