The story is OK (even if they changed a few things from the graphic novel that I was not really happy about). I am talking about the drawings.\nThe beauty of comic books is the amount of freedom the artist can have. There are rules but often the best work happens when those rules are broken. Look at the work of Frank Miller as an example.\nIn his drawings the lights and the shadows are often wrong and not realistic. But the result are really powerful images.\nThey tried to reproduce this when filming the movie adapted from Sin City but it didn‚Äôt work as well. They got as close as possible, but every medium has its limitations.\nAnimated movies can push these boundaries a bit more: that‚Äôs why I was disappointed when I saw ‚ÄúBatman: The Long Halloween‚Äù. The animators decided to go more in the direction of an actual movie, than towards the comic books style. And that‚Äôs boring.\nLook at this scene:\nThe image on the right is more realistic, the lights are softer, the blood spreads slowly in the water, etc. The question is: does it have to be? Those rules apply photography or film, not to drawings. Looking at Batman: The Long Halloween the only thing I could think about was something like \u0026ldquo;we wanted to make an actual movie with real actors but we couldn‚Äôt, so we did this, which we think is close enough. Everything would work exactly the same if there were real actors. The only problem is that they are not there.\u0026rdquo;.\nThey imposed on themselves limitations that don\u0026rsquo;t exist.\nOn the same note, playing with the shadows and having Batman appear from the dark and mix with the shadows has being part of the character for ages but somehow the people that designed this movie completely forgot about it.\nThis is what we got:\nIt just boggles my mind the fact that the best animated version of Batman is still a cartoon intro from 30 years ago.\n","permalink":"https://iamfran.com/posts/2022/08/batman-the-long-halloween-and-the-power-of-comic-books/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.snap.as/MynPiJE0.jpeg\" alt=\"Batman: The Long Halloween cover\"  /\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recently watched ‚ÄúBatman: The Long Halloween‚Äù, a 3 hours long animated movie based on the graphic novel of the same name, and I was extremely disappointed by the lack of imagination displayed in it.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"‚ÄúBatman: The Long Halloween‚Äù And The Power Of Comic Books"},{"content":" I couldn‚Äôt stand the default icon for mymind , so I made a quick one for it.\nBefore:\nAfter:\nüëâ You can download it here .\nTo design it I used this Figma template from V√°clav Vanƒçura.\n","permalink":"https://iamfran.com/posts/2022/05/an-icon-for-mymind/","summary":"I couldn‚Äôt stand the default icon for mymind , so I made a quick one for it.\nBefore:\nAfter:\nüëâ You can download it here .\nTo design it I used this Figma template from V√°clav Vanƒçura.","title":"An Icon For mymind"},{"content":"Bio I like taking pictures (especially when I travel), watching movies , and reading books .\nCV Mar 2022 ‚Äî current Head of UX Design at Greenflux Redesigning our product to stand out in the global marketplace Creating a new Design System to support the growth of our platform Implementing UX reasoning and research in our design process Mar 2017 ‚Äî Feb 2022 Design Director at Spotzer Managing the global Design and WP Development teams Overviewing the production of up to 4000 sites per month Redefining processes to improve business scalability Design PoC for all of global Partners Oct 2016 - Feb 2017 Lead Designer at Spotzer Developing Design Guidelines and training sessions Restructuring the team to support the business growth Improving our templates and design scalability Jun 2016 - Sep 2016 Web Designer at Spotzer Designing websites, logos, and templates Supporting the launch of new Partners Training employees in design best practices Dec 2015 - May 2016 Graphic Designer at Obiettivo Crescita\nRebranding of the magazine Designing the monthly cover art Building the main website as well as partners sites Mar 2009 - Nov 2015 3D Designer at HG Architecture\nDesigning architecture plans in Archicad and AutoCAD Modelling 3D objects in Rhinoceros and Blender Rendering and editing images in Photoshop Education Bachelor Degree in Architecture\nSkills User Experience Design Systems Interface/Product Design Project Management Product Management Team Management Workflows Improvement Problem Solving Business Scalability Web Design Download And for those who still like using actual paper, here you can download my CV as a PDF file.\n","permalink":"https://iamfran.com/about/","summary":"about","title":"About"},{"content":"Things 3 Rulebook PaperMod Mod Theme for Hugo iPhone Norway Wallpapers ","permalink":"https://iamfran.com/projects/","summary":"about","title":"Projects"}]
