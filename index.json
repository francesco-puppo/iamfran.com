The story is OK (even if they changed a few things from the graphic novel that I was not really happy about). I am talking about the drawings.\nThe beauty of comic books is the amount of freedom the artist can have. There are rules but often the best work happens when those rules are broken. Look at the work of Frank Miller as an example.\nIn his drawings the lights and the shadows are often wrong and not realistic. But the result are really powerful images.\nThey tried to reproduce this when filming the movie adapted from Sin City but it didn’t work as well. They got as close as possible, but every medium has its limitations.\nAnimated movies can push these boundaries a bit more: that’s why I was disappointed when I saw “Batman: The Long Halloween”. The animators decided to go more in the direction of an actual movie, than towards the comic books style. And that’s boring.\nLook at this scene:\nThe image on the right is more realistic, the lights are softer, the blood spreads slowly in the water, etc. The question is: does it have to be? Those rules apply photography or film, not to drawings. Looking at Batman: The Long Halloween the only thing I could think about was something like \u0026ldquo;we wanted to make an actual movie with real actors but we couldn’t, so we did this, which we think is close enough. Everything would work exactly the same if there were real actors. The only problem is that they are not there.\u0026rdquo;.\nThey imposed on themselves limitations that don\u0026rsquo;t exist.\nOn the same note, playing with the shadows and having Batman appear from the dark and mix with the shadows has being part of the character for ages but somehow the people that designed this movie completely forgot about it.\nThis is what we got:\nIt just boggles my mind the fact that the best animated version of Batman is still a cartoon intro from 30 years ago.\n","permalink":"https://iamfran.com/posts/2022/08/batman-the-long-halloween-and-the-power-of-comic-books/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.snap.as/MynPiJE0.jpeg\" alt=\"Batman: The Long Halloween cover\"  /\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recently watched “Batman: The Long Halloween”, a 3 hours long animated movie based on the graphic novel of the same name, and I was extremely disappointed by the lack of imagination displayed in it.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"“Batman: The Long Halloween” And The Power Of Comic Books"},{"content":" I couldn’t stand the default icon for mymind , so I made a quick one for it.\nBefore:\nAfter:\n👉 You can download it here .\nTo design it I used this Figma template from Václav Vančura.\n","permalink":"https://iamfran.com/posts/2022/05/an-icon-for-mymind/","summary":"I couldn’t stand the default icon for mymind , so I made a quick one for it.\nBefore:\nAfter:\n👉 You can download it here .\nTo design it I used this Figma template from Václav Vančura.","title":"An Icon For mymind"},{"content":" I took some time yesterday to customise my blog and create this beautiful theme for the blogging platform I use.\nI created this theme to make sure that my blog was in line with the design of my personal website .\nBelow you will find some notes and instructions on how to install the theme. If you want to download it immediately, please head over to 👉 GitHub .\nDark palette with orange highlights I used a dark palette with some orange highlights to mimic the look and feel of my site but don’t worry, changing it is super easy thanks to CSS variables.\nCSS variables Thanks to CSS variables you can easily the colours and fonts of the theme with just a few clicks. No need to hunt down all the references to a specific color in the CSS. Check the beginning of the file to see all of the variables I have used and easily replace them.\nBeautiful fonts A selection of Google fonts now replace the default font set by Write.as. Cormorant Garamond has been used for titles and everything else is in Open Sans. Source Code Pro applies to to tags and other \u0026ldquo;code-like\u0026rdquo; elements.\nWhite background for articles As much as I love using dark palette schemes, I hate reading long articles that use a dark background.\nFully responsive Honestly, I didn’t have to do too much here since write.as is already well optisized for mobile.\nThe main thing I did is increasing the font size of the articles.\nAnimations Don’t expect crazy things. I wanted to keep the focus on the content. Apart from some hover effects, the only animations I added are on the hashtag near the titles of the articles and on the images.\nShadows for every image Every image displays a soft shadow behind it. A small touch that makes everything look more professional.\nCustomised pages for tags archives When clicking on a tag (i.e. #movies), Write.as automatically generates a page to browse through all the articles tagged with it. Those pages have been customised as well.\nLove for the details The ones above are just some of the refinements I added but is there is a lot more, like a subtle light gradient coming from the top of the page, or the rounded corners in the article page, the fonts pairing, etc.\nHow to edit it To edit the theme, download it from GitHub and open it in an editor like Visual Studio Code .\nIf you want to change the variables of the color, for example, you can find them at the beginning of the file. Changing these will change the colours across the entire theme.\nI tried to keep the CSS as clean as possible, so it shouldn’t be a problem finding things.\nHow to install it Download the theme from GitHub and then head over to Write.as.\nIn your blog settings search for Customise, and then scroll down to Custom CSS.

Thomas Pynchon\nLove with your mouth shut, help without breaking your ass or publicizing it: keep cool, but care.\nThis book is just too much\u0026hellip; I honestly can\u0026rsquo;t give a vote to it. I was enjoying the first part of this book but then\u0026hellip; Well, then Pynchon really starts being Pynchon and you start realising that :\nNothing makes sense Everything is completely absurd At the same time, everything seems to have a deeper significance (or maybe not, who knows?) but more than anything: You know you will not understand it Life\u0026rsquo;s single lesson: that there is more accident to it than a man can ever admit to in a lifetime and stay sane.\nMotherless Brooklyn Jonathan Letham\nSomeday I\u0026rsquo;d change my name to Shut Up and save everybody a lot of time.\nA good detective story, where the main character suffers from Tourette\u0026rsquo;s syndrome. The book has plenty of interesting ideas and inventions (that reminded me of The Thought Gang, one of the funniest books I have ever read), making it an above-average book for sure.\nFor Whom The Bell Tolls Ernest Hemingway\nThe world is a fine place and worth fighting for and I hate very much to leave it.\nReally good but I still thinks Hemingways’ best work are his short stories.\nGargoyles Thomas Bernard\nIt would be wrong to refuse to face the fact [\u0026hellip;] that everything is fundamentally sick and sad.\nDepressing. And beautiful. But still depressing.\nThe first half is about a doctor and his son travelling around post-WWI Austria visiting patients, while the second half is a 200 pages monologue (yes, two hundred pages of monologue) of Prince Sarau, another one of his patients. While the first half is as easy to follow as it is depressing to read, the second half is a whole other story: reading Prince Sarau\u0026rsquo;s monologue you have the impression to be sitting in front of a crazy man listening to his train of thoughts but, here and there, there are brilliant moments of beautiful writing and reflections on humanity\u0026rsquo;s situation.\nP.S. The Italian title of the book is Perturbamento.\nGuns, Germs, and Steel ⭐️ Jared Diamond\nIn short, Europe’s colonization of Africa had nothing to do with differences between European and African peoples themselves, as white racists assume.\nIt should be considered as the ultimate book against racism.\nAnd Then There Were None Agatha Christie\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know. I don\u0026rsquo;t know at all. And that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s frightening the life out of me. To have no idea\u0026hellip;\nThis was the first time for me approaching this story and I really liked it. Short and captivating, you try guessing who the killer is until the last page.\nPoirot - Short Stories Agatha Christie\nThe biggest strength of these stories, I think, is the fact that, if you pay a lot of attention, you may be able to solve the case the same way that Poirot does. Every clue is there, hidden in the pages. It’s not the lazy writing you find in other crime books or stories.\nThe New York Trilogy Paul Auster\nOnly darkness has the power to make a man open his heart to the world.\nAn absurd “thriller” trilogy. A unique book, that will transport you in a world were things seem off and you start questioning reality.\nNumero Zero Umberto Eco\nNot Eco’s strongest book. Far from that. It’s like a simplified and shortened version of Foucault’s Pendulum, never reaching the same heights.\nThe Dinner Herman Koch\nBig success in the Netherlands. It’s definitely a gripping book and it has a strong plot twist at the end with a clear political message. Still, the book is not that good.\nLa Macchina Del Vento Wu Ming 2\nInteresting for the story it tells: the Italian partigiani exiled on the island of Ventotene by the Fascist party that will then set the basis for the Italian republic. Still, if you want to start reading Wu Ming, this book is not in the top five and probably not even in the top ten.\nThe Aleph and Other Stories Jorge Louis Borges\nI saw all the mirrors on earth and none of them reflected me.\nA universe of topics and stories that I could not imagine in a lifetime. The story I liked the most is probably “The Immortal”.\nMake Time Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky\nA light-hearted productivity book focus on creating habits and tactics every day to improve your productivity and your life. I am not a fan of productivity gurus and these kind of books but the authors’s light approach makes it really enjoyable.\nIl Diavolo Sulle Colline Cesare Pavese\nI loved this story mainly because it’s set near where I was born and it made me realize how much I miss those places.\nThe Remains Of The Day ⭐️ ❤️ Kazuo Ishiguro\nSuch decisions were no longer a matter simply of wages, the size of staff at one’s disposal or the splendour of a family name; for our generation, I think it fair to say, professional prestige lay most significantly in the moral worth of one’s employer.\nIf you told me that I would have loved the story of a butler taking a break and driving through post-WWII England’s countryside I would not have believed you. And yet, same as for The Buried Giant, Kazuo Ishiguro is able to create masterpieces out of simple, yet powerful, plots.\nThe Yiddish Policemen Union Michael Chabon\nEvery generation loses the Messiah it has failed to deserve.\nA nice detective story set in an alternative history were, during WWII, Jewish refugees live in a settlement in Alaska. The Coen brothers were supposed to make a movie out of it but apparently they dropped the project.\nWar And Peace ⭐️ Lev Tolstoy\nI simply want to live; to cause no evil to anyone but myself.\nThis one has been on my reading list for years, almost decades. A few months ago I finally found the courage to go through it and, I have to say, it’s a really enjoyable read! Sure, some chapters are a bit hard to digest but they are usually pretty short and Tolstoy often jumps from on character to another, in a very modern way. It’s impossible to describe everything that this book contains, from the depiction of Russia’s aristocracy, to Napoleon’s portrait and his battles, from the descriptions of each character feelings, to a deep dive into their thoughts and minds. As Romain Rolland said: “this work, like life itself, has no beginning, no end. It is life itself in its eternal movement”.\nImpossibile Erri De Luca\nVado in montagna per perdermi. E ritrovarmi.\nA really short read about a suspect that is being interrogated about a possible murder he may have committed while trekking in the mountains. The best part of the book are the author’s thought on what it means “to live the mountain”. And I agree with every word he wrote.\nThe Three Body Problem Lui Cixin\nYour lack of fear is based on your ignorance.\nDespite Lui Cixin’s horrible opinion on China’s re-education camps, the book is a really enjoyable and gripping read. If I had enough time I would have read it all in one go because, when I was reading it, I was living in that universe. And that’s what makes a good book. Hard science fiction or not, for me it was a breath of fresh air.\nThe Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald\nI was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.”\nI probably needed a more solid background on USA’s culture of the time to fully appreciate this book. I liked it but I felt like I was missing something.\nFlatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions ⭐️ ❤️ Edwin A. Abbott\nThe use of Colour was abolished, and its possession prohibited. Even the utterance of any word denoting Colour, except by the Circles or by qualified scientific teachers, was punished by a severe penalty.\nA satirical view of Victorian culture set in a two-dimensional world and written in 1884. It’s genius. It’s funny. It’s inspiring. I did not have so much fun and wonder while reading a book as I had with this one in a long time.\n","permalink":"https://iamfran.com/posts/2021/01/books-i-have-read-in-2020/","summary":"A list of the books I read last year, with some ratings, quotes, and impressions.\n⭐️ = A masterpiece ❤️ = I loved it\nV.

Just before going to bed, we take her outside for a really short time so she can pee before going to sleep Food Diet Tula is allergic to some kind of meat, we don\u0026rsquo;t exactly now which one, which is why we keep her on an insects based diet (we try to keep her off of dairy products as well).\nEven the treats she gets are either insect based, vegan, or vegetarian. If she gets some normal treat from time to time it\u0026rsquo;s not an issue, as long as it\u0026rsquo;s not every day.\nRoutines She doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a particular routine but we usually feed her at these hours:\n08:00–09:00 One cup of dry food 18:00–19:00 One cup of dry food She then gets a few treats during the day. Usually this happens when we come back together from a walk or once we get back home after leaving her alone for some time.\nInside At home she\u0026rsquo;s used to go on the couch or even the bed if she wants to but, of course, feel free to stop her if she tries the same at your place.\nSleep Tula sleeps a lot and is not an early morning type of dog. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to rush downstairs at 07:00.

It\u0026rsquo;s something we are still trying to teach her.\nFeel free to let her off the leash if the area is safe and there\u0026rsquo;s enough space around. She won\u0026rsquo;t run away and is pretty good at coming back when calling her.\nWith humans Tula tends to ignore human beings, cyclists and children included, unless they have food (obviously).\nWith other dogs Playing with other dogs is not her favourite thing unless she finds someone that she really likes. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that she gets aggressive, she just ignores them.\nBall or no ball If you start playing with a ball she\u0026rsquo;ll get obsessed and ignore everything else around her.\nThis has pros and cons. It\u0026rsquo;s good if there\u0026rsquo;s no one around and you want her to get tired (good luck because it might require hundreds of throws) but, if you want her to familiarise or play with other dogs it\u0026rsquo;s better to avoid showing her that you have a ball.\nSwimming Tula loves swimming and fetching sticks you throw in the water. The only catch is that she needs to be able to get in the water gently because otherwise she won\u0026rsquo;t jump.\nDictionary Bad girl: Cattiva Ball: Pallina (small) / Palla (big) Bed (for dogs): Cuccia Come here: Vieni Drop it: Lascia Fetch the ball: Riporta la pallina Go to your bed: Vai a cuccia Good girl: Brava Let\u0026rsquo;s go: Andiamo Sit: Seduta Stay: Ferma Stop: Basta ","permalink":"https://iamfran.com/others/tula/","summary":"Tula\u0026rsquo;s Handbook","title":"Tula's Handbook"}]
