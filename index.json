The story is OK (even if they changed a few things from the graphic novel that I was not really happy about). I am talking about the drawings.\nThe beauty of comic books is the amount of freedom the artist can have. There are rules but often the best work happens when those rules are broken. Look at the work of Frank Miller as an example.\nIn his drawings the lights and the shadows are often wrong and not realistic. But the result are really powerful images.\nThey tried to reproduce this when filming the movie adapted from Sin City but it didn’t work as well. They got as close as possible, but every medium has its limitations.\nAnimated movies can push these boundaries a bit more: that’s why I was disappointed when I saw “Batman: The Long Halloween”. The animators decided to go more in the direction of an actual movie, than towards the comic books style. And that’s boring.\nLook at this scene:\nThe image on the right is more realistic, the lights are softer, the blood spreads slowly in the water, etc. The question is: does it have to be? Those rules apply photography or film, not to drawings. Looking at Batman: The Long Halloween the only thing I could think about was something like \u0026ldquo;we wanted to make an actual movie with real actors but we couldn’t, so we did this, which we think is close enough. Everything would work exactly the same if there were real actors. The only problem is that they are not there.\u0026rdquo;.\nThey imposed on themselves limitations that don\u0026rsquo;t exist.\nOn the same note, playing with the shadows and having Batman appear from the dark and mix with the shadows has being part of the character for ages but somehow the people that designed this movie completely forgot about it.\nThis is what we got:\nIt just boggles my mind the fact that the best animated version of Batman is still a cartoon intro from 30 years ago.\n","permalink":"https://iamfran.com/posts/2022/08/batman-the-long-halloween-and-the-power-of-comic-books/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.snap.as/MynPiJE0.jpeg\" alt=\"Batman: The Long Halloween cover\"  /\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recently watched “Batman: The Long Halloween”, a 3 hours long animated movie based on the graphic novel of the same name, and I was extremely disappointed by the lack of imagination displayed in it.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"“Batman: The Long Halloween” And The Power Of Comic Books"},{"content":" I couldn’t stand the default icon for mymind , so I made a quick one for it.\nBefore:\nAfter:\n👉 You can download it here .\nTo design it I used this Figma template from Václav Vančura.\n","permalink":"https://iamfran.com/posts/2022/05/an-icon-for-mymind/","summary":"I couldn’t stand the default icon for mymind , so I made a quick one for it.\nBefore:\nAfter:\n👉 You can download it here .\nTo design it I used this Figma template from Václav Vančura.","title":"An Icon For mymind"},{"content":" I took some time yesterday to customise my blog and create this beautiful theme for the blogging platform I use.\nI created this theme to make sure that my blog was in line with the design of my personal website .\nBelow you will find some notes and instructions on how to install the theme. If you want to download it immediately, please head over to 👉 GitHub .\nDark palette with orange highlights I used a dark palette with some orange highlights to mimic the look and feel of my site but don’t worry, changing it is super easy thanks to CSS variables.\nCSS variables Thanks to CSS variables you can easily the colours and fonts of the theme with just a few clicks. No need to hunt down all the references to a specific color in the CSS. Check the beginning of the file to see all of the variables I have used and easily replace them.\nBeautiful fonts A selection of Google fonts now replace the default font set by Write.as. Cormorant Garamond has been used for titles and everything else is in Open Sans. Source Code Pro applies to to tags and other \u0026ldquo;code-like\u0026rdquo; elements.\nWhite background for articles As much as I love using dark palette schemes, I hate reading long articles that use a dark background.\nFully responsive Honestly, I didn’t have to do too much here since write.as is already well optisized for mobile.\nThe main thing I did is increasing the font size of the articles.\nAnimations Don’t expect crazy things. I wanted to keep the focus on the content. Apart from some hover effects, the only animations I added are on the hashtag near the titles of the articles and on the images.\nShadows for every image Every image displays a soft shadow behind it. A small touch that makes everything look more professional.\nCustomised pages for tags archives When clicking on a tag (i.e. #movies), Write.as automatically generates a page to browse through all the articles tagged with it. Those pages have been customised as well.\nLove for the details The ones above are just some of the refinements I added but is there is a lot more, like a subtle light gradient coming from the top of the page, or the rounded corners in the article page, the fonts pairing, etc.\nHow to edit it To edit the theme, download it from GitHub and open it in an editor like Visual Studio Code .\nIf you want to change the variables of the color, for example, you can find them at the beginning of the file. Changing these will change the colours across the entire theme.\nI tried to keep the CSS as clean as possible, so it shouldn’t be a problem finding things.\nHow to install it Download the theme from GitHub and then head over to Write.as.\nIn your blog settings search for Customise, and then scroll down to Custom CSS. Paste the code, and then click on Save changes.\n👉 Download it on GitHub ","permalink":"https://iamfran.com/posts/2022/02/a-dark-theme-for-write.as/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.snap.as/xZuovPhQ.jpg\" alt=\"Theme preview\"  /\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took some time yesterday to customise my blog and create this \u003cem\u003ebeautiful\u003c/em\u003e theme for the blogging platform I use.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"A Dark Theme For write.as"},{"content":"A list of the books I read last year, with some ratings, quotes, and impressions.\n⭐️ = A masterpiece ❤️ = I loved it\nV. Thomas Pynchon\nLove with your mouth shut, help without breaking your ass or publicizing it: keep cool, but care.\nThis book is just too much\u0026hellip; I honestly can\u0026rsquo;t give a vote to it. I was enjoying the first part of this book but then\u0026hellip; Well, then Pynchon really starts being Pynchon and you start realising that :\nNothing makes sense Everything is completely absurd At the same time, everything seems to have a deeper significance (or maybe not, who knows?) but more than anything: You know you will not understand it Life\u0026rsquo;s single lesson: that there is more accident to it than a man can ever admit to in a lifetime and stay sane.\nMotherless Brooklyn Jonathan Letham\nSomeday I\u0026rsquo;d change my name to Shut Up and save everybody a lot of time.\nA good detective story, where the main character suffers from Tourette\u0026rsquo;s syndrome. The book has plenty of interesting ideas and inventions (that reminded me of The Thought Gang, one of the funniest books I have ever read), making it an above-average book for sure.\nFor Whom The Bell Tolls Ernest Hemingway\nThe world is a fine place and worth fighting for and I hate very much to leave it.\nReally good but I still thinks Hemingways’ best work are his short stories.\nGargoyles Thomas Bernard\nIt would be wrong to refuse to face the fact [\u0026hellip;] that everything is fundamentally sick and sad.\nDepressing. And beautiful. But still depressing.\nThe first half is about a doctor and his son travelling around post-WWI Austria visiting patients, while the second half is a 200 pages monologue (yes, two hundred pages of monologue) of Prince Sarau, another one of his patients. While the first half is as easy to follow as it is depressing to read, the second half is a whole other story: reading Prince Sarau\u0026rsquo;s monologue you have the impression to be sitting in front of a crazy man listening to his train of thoughts but, here and there, there are brilliant moments of beautiful writing and reflections on humanity\u0026rsquo;s situation.\nP.S. The Italian title of the book is Perturbamento.\nGuns, Germs, and Steel ⭐️ Jared Diamond\nIn short, Europe’s colonization of Africa had nothing to do with differences between European and African peoples themselves, as white racists assume.\nIt should be considered as the ultimate book against racism.\nAnd Then There Were None Agatha Christie\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know. I don\u0026rsquo;t know at all. And that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s frightening the life out of me. To have no idea\u0026hellip;\nThis was the first time for me approaching this story and I really liked it. Short and captivating, you try guessing who the killer is until the last page.\nPoirot - Short Stories Agatha Christie\nThe biggest strength of these stories, I think, is the fact that, if you pay a lot of attention, you may be able to solve the case the same way that Poirot does. Every clue is there, hidden in the pages. It’s not the lazy writing you find in other crime books or stories.\nThe New York Trilogy Paul Auster\nOnly darkness has the power to make a man open his heart to the world.\nAn absurd “thriller” trilogy. A unique book, that will transport you in a world were things seem off and you start questioning reality.\nNumero Zero Umberto Eco\nNot Eco’s strongest book. Far from that. It’s like a simplified and shortened version of Foucault’s Pendulum, never reaching the same heights.\nThe Dinner Herman Koch\nBig success in the Netherlands. It’s definitely a gripping book and it has a strong plot twist at the end with a clear political message. Still, the book is not that good.\nLa Macchina Del Vento Wu Ming 2\nInteresting for the story it tells: the Italian partigiani exiled on the island of Ventotene by the Fascist party that will then set the basis for the Italian republic. Still, if you want to start reading Wu Ming, this book is not in the top five and probably not even in the top ten.\nThe Aleph and Other Stories Jorge Louis Borges\nI saw all the mirrors on earth and none of them reflected me.\nA universe of topics and stories that I could not imagine in a lifetime. The story I liked the most is probably “The Immortal”.\nMake Time Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky\nA light-hearted productivity book focus on creating habits and tactics every day to improve your productivity and your life. I am not a fan of productivity gurus and these kind of books but the authors’s light approach makes it really enjoyable.\nIl Diavolo Sulle Colline Cesare Pavese\nI loved this story mainly because it’s set near where I was born and it made me realize how much I miss those places.\nThe Remains Of The Day ⭐️ ❤️ Kazuo Ishiguro\nSuch decisions were no longer a matter simply of wages, the size of staff at one’s disposal or the splendour of a family name; for our generation, I think it fair to say, professional prestige lay most significantly in the moral worth of one’s employer.\nIf you told me that I would have loved the story of a butler taking a break and driving through post-WWII England’s countryside I would not have believed you. And yet, same as for The Buried Giant, Kazuo Ishiguro is able to create masterpieces out of simple, yet powerful, plots.\nThe Yiddish Policemen Union Michael Chabon\nEvery generation loses the Messiah it has failed to deserve.\nA nice detective story set in an alternative history were, during WWII, Jewish refugees live in a settlement in Alaska. The Coen brothers were supposed to make a movie out of it but apparently they dropped the project.\nWar And Peace ⭐️ Lev Tolstoy\nI simply want to live; to cause no evil to anyone but myself.\nThis one has been on my reading list for years, almost decades. A few months ago I finally found the courage to go through it and, I have to say, it’s a really enjoyable read! Sure, some chapters are a bit hard to digest but they are usually pretty short and Tolstoy often jumps from on character to another, in a very modern way. It’s impossible to describe everything that this book contains, from the depiction of Russia’s aristocracy, to Napoleon’s portrait and his battles, from the descriptions of each character feelings, to a deep dive into their thoughts and minds. As Romain Rolland said: “this work, like life itself, has no beginning, no end. It is life itself in its eternal movement”.\nImpossibile Erri De Luca\nVado in montagna per perdermi. E ritrovarmi.\nA really short read about a suspect that is being interrogated about a possible murder he may have committed while trekking in the mountains. The best part of the book are the author’s thought on what it means “to live the mountain”. And I agree with every word he wrote.\nThe Three Body Problem Lui Cixin\nYour lack of fear is based on your ignorance.\nDespite Lui Cixin’s horrible opinion on China’s re-education camps, the book is a really enjoyable and gripping read. If I had enough time I would have read it all in one go because, when I was reading it, I was living in that universe. And that’s what makes a good book. Hard science fiction or not, for me it was a breath of fresh air.\nThe Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald\nI was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.”\nI probably needed a more solid background on USA’s culture of the time to fully appreciate this book. I liked it but I felt like I was missing something.\nFlatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions ⭐️ ❤️ Edwin A. Abbott\nThe use of Colour was abolished, and its possession prohibited. Even the utterance of any word denoting Colour, except by the Circles or by qualified scientific teachers, was punished by a severe penalty.\nA satirical view of Victorian culture set in a two-dimensional world and written in 1884. It’s genius. It’s funny. It’s inspiring. I did not have so much fun and wonder while reading a book as I had with this one in a long time.\n","permalink":"https://iamfran.com/posts/2021/01/books-i-have-read-in-2020/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA list of the books I read last year, with some ratings, quotes, and impressions.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Books I Have Read In 2020"},{"content":"Bio I like taking pictures (especially when I travel), watching movies , and reading books .\nCV Mar 2022 — current Head of UX Design at Greenflux Redesigning our product to stand out in the global marketplace Creating a new Design System to support the growth of our platform Implementing UX reasoning and research in our design process Mar 2017 — Feb 2022 Design Director at Spotzer Managing the global Design and WP Development teams Overviewing the production of up to 4000 sites per month Redefining processes to improve business scalability Design PoC for all of global Partners Oct 2016 - Feb 2017 Lead Designer at Spotzer Developing Design Guidelines and training sessions Restructuring the team to support the business growth Improving our templates and design scalability Jun 2016 - Sep 2016 Web Designer at Spotzer Designing websites, logos, and templates Supporting the launch of new Partners Training employees in design best practices Dec 2015 - May 2016 Graphic Designer at Obiettivo Crescita\nRebranding of the magazine Designing the monthly cover art Building the main website as well as partners sites Mar 2009 - Nov 2015 3D Designer at HG Architecture\nDesigning architecture plans in Archicad and AutoCAD Modelling 3D objects in Rhinoceros and Blender Rendering and editing images in Photoshop Education Bachelor Degree in Architecture\nSkills User Experience Design Systems Interface/Product Design Project Management Product Management Team Management Workflows Improvement Problem Solving Business Scalability Web Design Download And for those who still like using actual paper, here you can download my CV as a PDF file.\n","permalink":"https://iamfran.com/about/","summary":"about","title":"About"},{"content":" An Icon For mymind A Dark Theme For write.as ","permalink":"https://iamfran.com/projects/","summary":"about","title":"Projects"}]
