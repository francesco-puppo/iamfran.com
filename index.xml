      <description>Last year I was in Norway for my honeymoon and I was blown away every day of our road trip by the incredible landscape.
Everywhere you looked there was something worth shooting; hopefully I was able to capture some of that magic&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Apps Stack for 2023</title>
      <link>https://iamfran.com/posts/2023/02/apps-stack-for-2023/</link>

      <description>As you will see, the one below is a pretty opinionated list.
I avoid apps that try to do a thousand different things and end up doing all of them in a bad way. I much prefer simple apps that have great UX, beautiful UI, and a clear set of features.
I also try to follow the concept of Max VP when selecting which apps to use and I try to focus on what I really need from them.</description>

      <title>Maximum Viable Product</title>
      <link>https://iamfran.com/posts/2023/01/maximum-viable-product/</link>

      <description>I recently found out about this concept which explains perfectly what I think a great product should represent.
We can define the Maximum Viable Product (Max VP) as a product that has just those features that allow it to be successful and no more. Customer needs are being met.
Instead of infinite grow (a concept at this point engrained in Silicon Valley companies) and the continuous adding of new features, a Max VP is a finely tuned engine that runs at full speed, where every feature has been carefully implemented and the UX is king.</description>

      <title>New Year, New Website - 2023 Edition</title>
      <link>https://iamfran.com/posts/2023/01/new-year-new-website-2023-edition/</link>

      <description>As tradition, I redesigned my website for the new year. After moving to Webflow in 2021 and hosting a simple HTML site in Github in 2022, this year I decided to go back to Hugo for a few reasons.
As much as I love Webflow, I can&amp;rsquo;t justify its price for what is, in the end, a passion project that I don&amp;rsquo;t update nearly as much as I should.
On the other hand, a static HTML site is ok for a such a small site but it&amp;rsquo;s not sustainable when you want to have a blog as well.</description>

      <description>I recently watched ‚ÄúBatman: The Long Halloween‚Äù, a 3 hours long animated movie based on the graphic novel of the same name, and I was extremely disappointed by the lack of imagination displayed in it.
And I am not talking about the story. The story is OK (even if they changed a few things from the graphic novel that I was not really happy about). I am talking about the drawings.</description>

      <description>A list of the books I read last year, with some ratings, quotes, and impressions.
‚≠êÔ∏è = A masterpiece ‚ù§Ô∏è = I loved it
V. Thomas Pynchon
Love with your mouth shut, help without breaking your ass or publicizing it: keep cool, but care.
This book is just too much&amp;hellip; I honestly can&amp;rsquo;t give a vote to it. I was enjoying the first part of this book but then&amp;hellip; Well, then Pynchon really starts being Pynchon and you start realising that :</description>
