      <description>As tradition, I redesigned my website for the new year. After moving to Webflow in 2021 and hosting a simple HTML site in Github in 2022, this year I decided to go back to Hugo for a few reasons.
As much as I love Webflow, I can&amp;rsquo;t justify its price for what is, in the end, a passion project that I don&amp;rsquo;t update nearly as much as I should.
On the other hand, a static HTML site is ok for a such a small site but it&amp;rsquo;s not sustainable when you want to have a blog as well.</description>
